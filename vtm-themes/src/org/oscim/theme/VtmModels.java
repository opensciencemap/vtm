 * If using Blender for new models, start fresh project delete camera and light source, keep blender render engine.
 * Export as .obj/fbx
 * Use Fbx converter [https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv] and Java GUI [https://github.com/ASneakyFox/libgdx-fbxconv-gui]
 * to convert to g3d.
 * .obj is supported, too, but has troubles with textures and materials.
